**Grade: 80 / 80**

**Overall Comments**

A very impressive analysis, especially given the relatively short timeframe to complete it. The technical aspects show a very strong grasp of the techniques learned in the class, and the predictive analysis is well designed and potential limitations are analyzed thoroughly. Well done!

# Grading

- **Concept (15/15)**:
  - **Criteria**
    - Is it sufficiently complex/challenging/sophisticated?
    - Is the final product useful/interesting/creative?
  - **Comments**
    - Well designed with real implications for the bike share in Chicago

* **Technical implementation (25/25)**:

  - **Criteria**
    - Was it well thought out?
    - Was each step done correctly?
    - Does it satisfy 2 of the guidelines listed below?
  - **Comments**
    - Very impressive, including the fishnet based analysis
    - Good predictive results as well
    - I could only get the dashboard to run locally (Heroku and Binder links weren't working) — let me know if you'd like help getting them running to use a part of a personal portfolio in the future

- **Visualization (25/25)**:
  - **Criteria**
    - How well does the data visualization serve its purpose?
    - Does it tell a clear story?
    - Are the colors/layout/titles well-chosen?
  - **Comments**
    - Impressive exploratory dashboard with multiple components

* **Writeup (15/15)**:
  - **Criteria**
    - Is all of the above explained clearly?
    - Does the 1-2 page writeup explain in depth all aspects of the project's implementation and final results?
  - **Comments**
    - Detailed and all of the relevant aspects are described, including motivations and limitations of the analysis

# Guidelines

The project is open-ended. The topic and technologies used are up to you.
However, the it must satisfy **at least two of the items below**:

- Data is collected through a means more sophisticated than downloading (e.g. scraping, API).
- At least one of the datasets contains more than 1,000,000 rows.
- It combines data collected from 3 or more different sources.
- The analysis of the data is reasonably complex, involving multiple steps
  (geospatial joins/operations, data shaping, data frame operations, etc).
- You use one of the analysis techniques for urban street networks (e.g., osmnx, pandana), clustering (e.g., scikit-learn), or raster datasets
- You perform a machine learning analysis with scikit-learn as part of the analysis.
- The webpage includes a significant interactive component (cross-filtering, interactive widgets, etc)
