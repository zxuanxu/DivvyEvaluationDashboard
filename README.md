# Divvy Evaluation Dashboard and Report  
#### Group Members: Zixuan Xu, Yuchen Zhang, Yuyang Yin
In this repository, we have projects organized in two main parts, dashboard and report.  
### Dashboard
For the dashboard, we have all the codes enclosed. The data is queried using API with approximately 3.6 million rows.    
- [Sample Application](https://chicago-bikeshare-app.herokuapp.com/Dashboard)  
  - Due to memory limitation, the online app is built on randomly selected sample data (200,000 rows). 
  - Code for sample app: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/zxuanxu/musa620-final-project/master?filepath=Dashboard.ipynb)  
  - [Repository for Sample Application](https://github.com/zxuanxu/musa620-final-project/blob/master/Dashboard.ipynb)  
- The full app can be viewed locally by running the **Dashboard.ipynb**.   
- Here is a screenshot of the full app.

### Report
For the report, we built a regression model to predict the bike-share demands across Chicago. You can refer to the document for full analysis and methodology.   
- The full code is **Report.ipynb**.  
- The full report is **Report.pdf**.  
### Conclusion  
For the project, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Divvy bike-share system in Chicago, with both data visualization dashboard and regression model analysis.
